Hello,

Here, I will explain the data that I will use in my project.

The first one is named 'laposte_hexasmal.csv', which you can downloaded from 
the website https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/base-officielle-des-codes-postaux/ with the file there 'Communes nouvelles'.
In this csv file, it contains the french version of name of borough, postcode, latitude and longitude. 
I need to clean this csv file to get dataframe of paris city named 'Paris_data'.
With the same process as I did in the 'Toronto neighbourhood data', I could obtain the results data named 
'Paris_grouped', 'Paris_merged', 'Paris_onehot', 'Paris_venues'.

The second ones are the data treated in the section of Toronto neighborhood data. 
They contain the coordinate data of Toronto 'df_toronto_coor', the coordinate data of Toronto downtown 'DowntownToronto_data',
the venues data 'Downtown_venues', 'Downtown_onehot', 'Downtown_merged', 'Downtown_grouped'.

The third ones are the data treated in the lab section Manhattan data. 
They contain the coordinate data of New York 'newyork_data', the coordinate data of Manhattan 'newyork_data',
the venues data 'manhattan_venues', 'manhattan_onehot', 'manhattan_merged', 'manhattan_grouped'.
