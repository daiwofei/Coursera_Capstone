Hello,

I am living in Paris, an international city, which is has more than 10 millon habitants and many monuments. 
So I want to explore the boroughs in Paris city. 
My project is to compare the similarity among the Manranton, Toronto downtown and Paris city.
The data of Paris city can be selected from the official data 'Communes nouvelles' in the website
https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/base-officielle-des-codes-postaux/.
First, I need to treat the data to get the 'Borough','Postcode','Latitude' and 'Longitude' in Paris.
Second, I need to ask for the venues from Foursquare to get the information of venues in Paris.
Third, I will compare the data of venues in Paris, Manranton and Toronto downtown.
Finally, I will use some visualisation tools (matplotlib, plotly, cofflinks) to show the data and tell their difference and similarity.
