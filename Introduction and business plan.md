# Explore Paris

Hello,

Paris, capital of France, is one of the largest metropolises in the world with a population of 2,148,271 habitants (official estimate, 1 January 2020) in an area of 105 square kilometers (41 square miles) . Paris ranks as 4th most expensive real estate city in the world from the data of UK branch of the American commercial real estate company CBRE. Because I have been in Paris for more than 5 years and I like to live in this beautiful city with a lower cost, it is very useful for me and the people like me to know the local prices of renting or buying a house in Paris. These information are also useful for those potential investor of property in Paris. That is my motivation to create a map and information chart to present the the real estate index in Paris and the density of venue in each district.
